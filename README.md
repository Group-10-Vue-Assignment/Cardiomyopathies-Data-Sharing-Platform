### Background to Project
Our Clientâ€™s business area is science based, more specifically related to the different forms of Cardiomyopathy. 
The Client wishes to have a central repository for the experimental data gathered through experiments on both animal and patient cells. This data is scattered around in published papers, different journals, and on the hard-drives of disparate and disconnected research groups and medical centres. 
This will be beneficial as interested parties will be able to query the data anywhere in the world, and so will help speed up the development of therapeutic interventions and disease prevention.
